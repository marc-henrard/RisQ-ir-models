# RisQ-ir-models by Marc Henrard

This repository proposes code for pricing and risk management of interest rate derivatives.

The models implemented are based on personal research and academic literature as described in each pricer.

RisQ stands for Risk management by Quantitative methods. The term risk management has to be understood as the actual management of risk, which goes beyond its measurement.

Comments and suggestions for improvements are welcomed.

Foundations
=======
The pricers proposed in this repository are based on OpenGamma strata library:
http://strata.opengamma.io/

The Strata release currently used in this library is Strata 1.1.

Contributions
======
If you are interested in collaborating in research on interest rate modeling and market infrastructure, I would be keen to hear about it. I would also happily published join work in this repository with full credit. 

Professional services
====

The model proposed here are only a small part of the code I developed or have access to for research and advisory services purposes. Donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you are interested by other models, require advisory services or are looking for a training around similar model.
